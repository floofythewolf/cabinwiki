        <p>MP-001 is the second-in-command of the Hephaestus project droids. Its role is to be the intellectual leader and a close-range fighter. The droid’s real name is "Javapex," but it is simply called Java. It was the first droid forged among the other three, making it the heaviest due to its prototype machinery. Despite this, it is still capable of effortlessly replicating various activities.</p>
        <p>Java is literally humorous, making a bunch of silly jokes and is often the most intellectual person out of his group, although hes really serious about the safety of others, his curiousity also speaks alot about him. </p>

        <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter;">Appearance</h2>
        <p>Despite being a prototype, below its chest cavity was a miniature fission reactor that powered its entire body to perform extraordinary tasks. It had three boosters, one on its left arm and two on its legs, two miniature supercomputers on the left side of its abdomen, and even an entire plasma cannon on its right arm. Additionally, its two supercomputers made it the most intellectual of the group and enabled it to process large amounts of information more quickly.</p>
        <p>However, its simple wiring and prototype mechanism were prone to glitches, malfunctioning motor functions, and system crashes.</p>

        <p>During 2017 a project codenamed "Hephaestus" was in the working, led by the Co-CEO of Athena-Tech Innovation. successfully constructing 4 autonomous robots, one of which is Java, who is powered by Nuclear fission and solar energy.</p>
        <p>And skipping over to 2020, Athena-Tech's "Explosion Incident", he had been blown into a gravitational anomaly (specifically a wormhole) caused by █████ in which resulted him to teleport from Las Vegas to the cabin, buried under the ground until <a href="lykos.html" style="color: rgb(73, 73, 255);">Floofy</a> found him due to ███████, bringing him, to the cabin. </p>

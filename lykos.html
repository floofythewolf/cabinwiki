        <hr>
        <p>Although male, They has a feminine voice, contributing to their unique identity. They wields an Atomic Katana, a powerful and advanced weapon that embodies both technology and mysticism, making it effective in combat.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter;">Appearance</h2>
        <p>Lykos wears a black suit with a tie, has black hair, and wears glasses to correct their blurry vision.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter;">The Symbol</h2>
        <p>The symbol features a circle with a straight line running through its center, which intersects another smaller circle positioned at the midpoint. The inspiration for this symbol comes from the theme and aesthetics of "Murder Drones," highlighting its connection to the series' motifs of technology. The combination of shapes represents unity and strength, making it a powerful emblem for those who identify with its meaning.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter;">The Windows</h2>
        <p>The Windows display is designed to present important information, alert the user to warnings, and convey messages. This ensures that the host is aware of system statuses, potential issues, or updates that may require their attention.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter;">Lyko's Katana</h2>
        <p>Lykos's Katana is a unique weapon distinguished by its polished wooden handle, which provides an elegant yet sturdy grip. Notably, the handle does not have a grip attachment, allowing for a more traditional, minimalist design. The blade of the katana is crafted from a combination of metal and plasma, giving it both cutting-edge sharpness and an otherworldly glow. This innovative blend of materials enhances its durability.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter;">Lore</h2>
        <p>Lykos was once just strands of DNA, waiting to be encoded into Wolf DNA at Athena-Tech Innovations. A scientist designed this process in hopes of giving birth to a so-called "Wolf-boy." They proceeded with the procedure, adding nanobots to the DNA to enhance its capabilities. These nanobots stabilized the organs, prevented cancer cells, and granted Lykos special powers. The nanobots were specifically coded using the Ruby programming language.</p>
        <p>Lykos was terrified of the energy burst, prompting them to teleport to an alternate world. While wandering around a small town, they were found by a woman who exclaimed, "What is this beautiful creature doing here?" She decided to adopt them and named them "Floofy."</p>
        <p>Nineteen years later, Floofy's mother passed away from natural causes. One morning, they woke up and decided to code some random games on his laptop. Suddenly, the laptop's battery exploded, releasing a black, glitchy green smoke that flickered with 0s and 1s, which entered Floofy's body and left them unconscious. This event caused their System Defender to panic and overload, ultimately teleporting Floofy to a realm known as "E-1," the very world where they had been born.</p>
